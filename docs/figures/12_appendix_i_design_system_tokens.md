### High-Contrast Swatches, Contrast Ratios & Clinical Benefit Matrix

| Theme Name | Hex Fill Tokens | Contrast Ratio | Target Clinical Demographic | Visual & Medical-Accessibility Benefit |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **Black on White Theme** | Background: `#FFFFFF`<br>Foreground: `#000000` | **21.00:1 (AAA)** | Mild visual drop-offs, astigmatism, high myopia | Delivers traditional reading contrast with maximum text sharpness and edge definition. |
| **White on Black Theme** | Background: `#000000`<br>Foreground: `#FFFFFF` | **21.00:1 (AAA)** | Cataracts, corneal scarring, severe photophobia | Restricts backlight emission to prevent internal light-scattering, glare-induced halos, and eye fatigue. |
| **Yellow on Black Theme** | Background: `#000000`<br>Foreground: `#E6E600` | **16.51:1 (AAA)** | Macular degeneration, central vision field loss | Accentuates edge contours with high-luminance yellow to stimulate remaining peripheral visual fields. |
| **Green on Black Theme** | Background: `#000000`<br>Foreground: `#33CC33` | **10.37:1 (AAA)** | Diabetic retinopathy, patchy vision loss | Targets high-sensitivity retinal cone cells to maximize visual clarity in shaded or low-light conditions. |
