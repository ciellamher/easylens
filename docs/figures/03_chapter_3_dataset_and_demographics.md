Figure 3.3
Dataset Curation and Pruning Workflow from 30 Raw Labels to the 24-Class Taxonomy

Note. Figure 3.3 shows how the raw Kaggle dataset (30 class folders, 38,262 images) was reduced to the 24-class taxonomy: the overlapping person and Person folders were merged, and five ghost classes too small to learn from (chair, handbag, traffic_light and umbrella with 3 images each; bench with 9) were removed. The final dataset contains 38,176 images (31,866 train / 4,185 validation / 2,125 test).

### Comparative Evaluation Matrix

| Architectural Dimension | Generic Web Dataset (Google OpenImages) | Custom EasyLens Pedestrian Dataset | Impact on Edge Performance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Volume** | > 9,000,000 images | 38,176 curated images | Optimized for rapid transfer learning convergence on mobile hardware |
| **Class Taxonomy** | > 600 generic classes | 24 critical pedestrian hazard classes | Eliminates classification ambiguity for immediate safety hazards |
| **Domain Specificity** | Unfiltered general web scenes | Pedestrian ground-level viewpoints & sidewalk obstacles | Higher recall for low-lying tripping hazards (cracks, potholes, steps) |
| **Regional Adaptation** | Global generic taxonomy | Unified `vehicle_other` covering Jeepneys & Tricycles | Prevents missed detections in dense Philippine urban traffic environments |
| **Edge Deployment Footprint** | Large multi-gigabyte models required | Quantized 14.8 MB MobileNetV2 SSD binary | Sub-20 ms inference on commodity Android smartphones |
